Let's play with Docker and learn something about it!

But wait, what the hell is Docker? [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an open platform to build, ship and run distributed applications anywhere. So you can run apps which "live" inside a contaniner runned and mannaged by Docker. It is similar to VirtualBox but Docker is lighter cause it's architectural approach.

It's very useful when you want to scale your app, the more load, the more containers containing the same app image you'll deploy very quickly. It could be like Amazon Auto Scaling Group but you won't deploy full machines.

The containers run images with your apps, in this post I will create 3 images (I will call them Archons). We will store the docker images into our [Docker Hub Repo](https://hub.docker.com).

**Installing Docker**

Im going to create an 20$/month Ubuntu Droplet in my [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) account and I will use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to install Docker.

{% alert info %}
I'm not going to explain what Ansible is and how to use it. In this post and the following ones I may use my own Ansible repo. I've promised to myself that I will write a wiki for that project ASAP.
{% endalert %}


So, let's clone my [Sysadmin Scripts](https://www.digitalocean.com) repo and I will use my Docker Role to install all the necesary packages in my droplet.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/a-castellano/Sysadmin-Scripts.git
cd Sysadmin-Scripts/Ansible/
```

Place your droplet IP into *inventory/my.hosts*.
``` ansible
[Docker]
YOUR_DROPLET_IP
```

If your is Ubuntu bersion is 16.04 you'll have to install python.
``` bash
ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP apt-get install -y python
```

Launch the playbook and reboot your droplet after the deployment.
``` bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/setup_docker/setup.yml
```

**Deploying dockers**

We will start creating our first Archon which will contain an Apache web server. We will create a container from the [official Debian Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian).

``` bash
docker create  --name ArchonWeb --hostname ArchonWeb -i debian
Unable to find image 'debian:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/debian

8ad8b3f87b37: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:2340a704d1f8f9ecb51c24d9cbce9f5ecd301b6b8ea1ca5eaba9edee46a2436d
Status: Downloaded newer image for debian:latest
584c54e123ec442b9c17a1645a9057406c67d8c80f72903a377f904ce9ae7269

```

Docker checks if there exists an image called "debian" in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com). If Docker doesn't have the latest version it will donwload it. When Docker gets the image it will create the container with debian inside.

``` bash
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
584c54e123ec        debian              "/bin/bash"         2 minutes ago       Created                                 ArchonWeb
```

Start the docker
``` bash
docker start ArchonWeb
```

``` bash
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
584c54e123ec        debian              "/bin/bash"         10 minutes ago      Up 6 seconds                            ArchonWeb
```

Ok, our first docker is alive, let's enter into it.

``` bash
docker exec -i -t ArchonWeb  /bin/bash
```

Hell Yeah! We are inside our first Docker container running!

As ArchonWeb will be a web server we are going to install Apache2.

``` bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils php5 php5-mcrypt php5-mysql php5-cli php5-common php5-json php5-readline php-pear libmcrypt4 libapache2-mod-php5 libmcrypt-dev mcrypt mariadb-client net-tools -y
service apache2 start
```

Apache2 is running!

``` bash
netstat -punta | grep LISTEN
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      3488/apache2
```

Wait, Apache2 is listening on a private address so we can't connect to this server. Don't start to cry yet, we can solve this issue.

We are making changes in our machine thereforce our first step will be create a new image from "debian" one.

Let's exit from our docker.

``` bash
exit
```

Stop the Docker

``` bash
docker stop ArchonWeb
```

Commit a new image called ArchonWeb from the original debian one.

``` bash
docker commit -m "Creating my first image" ArchonWeb
```

Now, we have two images in our machine.

``` bash
docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
<none>              <none>              YOUR_IMAGE_ID       57 seconds ago      262.4 MB
debian              latest              031143c1c662        3 days ago          125.1 MB
```

Ok, this is not beauty and it would be better to have our new image in a repository. Create and account in [Docker Repo](https://hub.docker.com) and create a new repo too.

{% image fancybox center clear group:travel https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/a-castellano.github.io/creating_repo.png  "Creating the repo" %}

Log to your Docker Hub account.

``` bash
docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: YOUR_USERNAME
Password: YOUR_PASSWORD
Login Succeeded
```

``` bash
docker commit -m "Creating my first image" ArchonWeb YOUR_USERNAME/archonweb
```


To probe that all is ok let's delete our container and all the images

``` bash
root@Docker:~|⇒  docker rm ArchonWeb
ArchonWeb
root@Docker:~|⇒  docker images
REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

```

Now we are going to create a new container with our own image and we will redirect the host port 8080 to our docker 80 port.

``` bash
docker create  --name ArchonWeb --hostname ArchonWeb -p 8080:80 -i YOUR_USERNAME/archonweb
docker start ArchonWeb
```

Start the container, enter into it and start the Apache2 web server. Now go to your docker host with port 8080 and you'll see the Apache default page.

{% image fancybox center clear group:travel https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/a-castellano.github.io/apache2_default_page.png  "Apache 2 Default Server" %}

You can configue the container to launch apache2 when you start the container.

```bash
docker create --name ArchonWeb --hostname ArchonWeb -p 8080:80 -i acastellano/archonweb /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND
docker start ArchonWeb
```

It works! Wait..... what happends if we put private webpages in our container, our conted will be public if we commit our images. Where the hell are my database for my web apps?

Keep calm, in the next adventure I will talk about volumes and Docker Composer (for automatize your dockers deployment.)

See you in the next post.
